# Instaclone

## **Code in master branch**

## What's this?

This app is a clone of Instagram built in React-Native and Expo. The user can upload his pictures to the App and will be displayed immediately after uploading. 
User can follow other users and see their posts on its feed. 
The user has the possibility of leaving comments on the picture.

## Why this?

I found building this App very useful as my first React-Native project to get used and comfortable working with mobile development.
Also to get an insight on microservices Architecture using Firebase Authentication and storage of Firestore. 

## Technologies I used

- HTML5, CSS3
- File Storing with Firestore
- React Native
- Firebase Authentication
